## Team Values
* The team will hold formal weekly meeting (on-line or inperson).
* Tasks are assigned to each team member weekly.
* Each team member will take full reponsibility of their work.
* Members who need help should mention the problems to the group directly in the slack group or weekly meeting.
* All team member have the responsibility to reply slack messages within 24 hours.
* When conflicts occur, all team members will vote, and the team will choose the option with the most votes.

## Sprint Cadence
* 2 weeks/sprint

## Daily Standups
* Every two days at 7PM, 10-20 minutes.
* Team members agree that if they cannot attend synchronously, they will message their progress in the slack group.
* Team members agree that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management.

## Coding Standards
* Specific editors/environments TBD as work on project progresses
* Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.
* Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
* Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
* Provide descriptive commit messages.
* Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
* Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
* Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).
